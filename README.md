# DU-paths
 This program is an implementation for searching all DU paths for some variable in software testing. Input file has a graph and variables with list of "def" and "use" nodes to search DU paths. First line is number of vertices and number of edges, then all edges of graph and variables with "def" nodes and "use" nodes. Output file has all DU paths for all variables.    https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~agurfink/ece653/assets/pdf/W04-DataflowCoverage.pdf
